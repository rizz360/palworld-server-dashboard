# Palworld Server Dashboard

Palworld Server Dashboard is a browser-based admin panel for managing a Palworld dedicated server through its REST API.

It gives you one place to handle the jobs you do most often:

- checking whether the server is healthy
- watching live player activity
- sending announcements
- kicking, banning, and unbanning players
- viewing live map positions
- monitoring FPS, uptime, and other server metrics

Built with Next.js, designed for self-hosting, and meant to feel much friendlier than working with raw API calls.

## Project Status ⚠️

This is a hobby project that was largely vibe-coded and shared in good faith, so expect rough edges, bugs, missing safeguards, and breaking changes over time.

Please treat it as a self-hosted community tool, not a guaranteed production platform. You are responsible for reviewing, testing, securing, and operating your own deployment.

## Overview 🎮

Running a game server usually means doing a lot of repetitive operational work:

- checking if the server is online
- seeing who is connected
- warning players before maintenance
- saving the world before a restart
- watching performance when the server is under load

This dashboard brings those tasks together into a single control surface with a more approachable UI.

## Features ✨

### Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard gives you a quick read on the current state of the server, including:

- connection status
- online player count
- uptime
- server information
- world settings
- recent in-app console activity

### Player Management

You can manage players directly from the UI:

- view online players
- search by name or user ID
- kick players
- ban players
- unban players

### Server Operations

The control cards let you handle common admin actions:

- send custom announcements
- use quick preset messages
- save the world
- schedule restart warnings
- shut down the server
- force stop the server

### Metrics and Monitoring

The metrics panel helps you keep an eye on performance:

- live FPS with a general-health verdict pill (composite score across all FPS
  signals — weighted blend plus veto floors so one critical signal alone can
  drag the verdict; hover it for the full breakdown)
- FPS history graph fed by a server-side sampler — populated for the full
  window even while the panel is closed, with honest gaps for downtime
  (see [Server-Side FPS History](#server-side-fps-history-))
- health tiles: Min / Avg / Max plus Median (the structural plateau),
  Longest <45 (worst continuous dip), and Under 30 (share of the window
  below 30 FPS)
- frame time
- uptime
- player capacity
- world day

### Live Map

The map view shows:

- player positions
- optional fast travel markers
- optional boss tower markers
- zoom and pan controls
- grouped player markers when players are close together

### Visual Customization

The dashboard includes multiple built-in visual themes, so server admins can choose the look they prefer without changing the code.

## How It Works 🔌

The browser never talks to the Palworld REST API directly.

Instead, the frontend sends requests to a local Next.js API route, and that route forwards the request to your Palworld server. This gives the project a few practical benefits:

- the admin password is not placed in URL query strings
- browser code stays simpler
- requests can be normalized before forwarding them

The app also stores some state in the browser, such as recent server data and optional saved connection details.

## Requirements 📋

You will need:

- Node.js `20.9.0` or newer
- npm `10` or newer
- a Palworld server with the REST API enabled
- the admin password for that server

Before starting, make sure you know:

- `Server IP or URL`
- `REST API port`
- `Game port`
- `Admin password`

Typical defaults used by the UI are:

- `REST API port`: `8212`
- `Game port`: `8211`

The exact server-side setup depends on how your Palworld server is hosted. If you are using a hosted panel, Docker image, or custom server setup, check that provider's instructions for enabling the REST API.

## Quick Start 🚀

Clone the project, install dependencies, and start the development server:

```bash
git clone <your-fork-or-repo-url>
cd palworld-server-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

If you are developing from another device on your local network, the dev server also exposes a network URL when started.

## Docker Quick Start 🐳

If you just want to run the dashboard, you can pull the published container image instead of building from source.

Before using the commands below, install Docker first:

- Docker Desktop is the easiest recommended option because it includes Docker Engine and Docker Compose on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- if you are on Linux and already manage Docker yourself, Docker Engine plus the Docker Compose plugin also works

Official install docs:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Pull the Image

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/rnz01/palworld-server-dashboard:latest
```

### Run the Image

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name palworld-server-dashboard \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/rnz01/palworld-server-dashboard:latest
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

### Run with Docker Compose

This repository includes a ready-to-use [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) that pulls the published image by default.

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

Optional overrides:

- `PALWORLD_SERVER_DASHBOARD_IMAGE` to point at a different tag or registry
- `PALWORLD_SERVER_DASHBOARD_PORT` to change the host port

## Server-Side FPS History 📈

The FPS histogram is fed by a small **server-side sampler**, not by the browser.
A stdlib-only Python script (`scripts/fps-sampler/palworld-fps-sampler.py`)
polls the game's `/v1/api/metrics` endpoint (default: every 5 s) and maintains a
rolling ring file covering the last hour. The panel reads that ring through its
own authenticated API and simply displays it.

Why it works this way:

- **Always populated** — the full window of history is there the moment you open
  the panel, even if nobody had it open. Browser tabs (hidden-tab timer
  throttling, closed panels) can no longer thin out or lose history.
- **Honest gaps** — if the game server (or the sampler) is down, nothing is
  recorded and the chart shows a gap instead of a made-up bridging line. The
  health verdict pill reports `No Data` / `Stale` / `Calibrating` instead of
  guessing.
- **Cheap** — one request every 5 s against the local REST API, atomic file
  writes, a few dozen kilobytes of state.

**Docker Compose:** nothing to do — `docker-compose.yml` runs the sampler as a
`python:3.12-alpine` sidecar sharing a metrics volume with the panel.

**Bare metal:** copy the script somewhere permanent, point it at your server
with `PALWORLD_REST_URL` / `PALWORLD_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, and keep it running —
`scripts/fps-sampler/palworld-fps-sampler.service.example` is a hardened
systemd unit template with setup steps in its header. Set
`PALWORLD_FPS_HISTORY_FILE` for the panel to the same path the sampler writes.

Sampler configuration (all optional):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PALWORLD_REST_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8212` | Game REST API base URL |
| `PALWORLD_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | — (required) | Game REST admin password |
| `FPS_HISTORY_FILE` | `/run/palworld-metrics/fps-history.json` | Ring file path |
| `FPS_SAMPLE_SECONDS` | `5` | Poll cadence (1-60) |
| `FPS_WINDOW_MINUTES` | `60` | History window (5-1440) |

Without a running sampler the panel still works — the FPS graph and health
tiles just report no data.

## First Connection Walkthrough 🧭

When you open the app, you will see the login/connect screen.

Fill in the fields like this:

### Server IP or URL

This is the host where your Palworld server can be reached.

Examples:

- `192.168.1.50`
- `play.example.com`
- `http://192.168.1.50`

### REST API Port

This is the Palworld REST API port, not the public gameplay port.

Default:

```text
8212
```

### Game Port

This is the gameplay port your server uses.

Default:

```text
8211
```

The dashboard stores this as part of the server profile so the UI can show the full server connection details.

### Admin Password

This is the password used to authenticate against the Palworld REST API.

### Remember Me

If enabled, the app stores the connection details in browser local storage on that machine so you do not need to re-enter them every time.

## Available Scripts 🛠️

### `npm run dev`

Starts the Next.js development server.

### `npm run typecheck`

Generates Next.js route types and runs the TypeScript checker.

### `npm run build`

Creates a production build.

### `npm run start`

Starts the production server from a built app.

### `npm run check`

Runs the full local verification flow:

- typecheck
- production build

## Development Notes 💻

### Local Network Access

This project is configured to allow development access from the machine's active local IPv4 addresses. That helps when you want to open the app from a LAN address instead of only `localhost`.

### Type Generation

The typecheck script clears `.next` before regenerating route types. This avoids stale generated files causing false TypeScript errors after route changes.

## Production and Deployment 🌐

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

The project uses Next.js standalone output, which makes self-hosting easier and is a good starting point for:

- VPS deployments
- internal dashboards
- containerized deployments
- reverse-proxy setups

### Container Image

The production container image is published to:

```text
ghcr.io/rnz01/palworld-server-dashboard:latest
```

The image is built from the included [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) and runs the Next.js standalone server on port `3000`.

### Automatic Image Publishing

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow at [.github/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml](./.github/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml).

On every push to `main`, the workflow:

- builds the Docker image
- publishes it to GitHub Container Registry
- updates the `latest` tag
- publishes a commit-specific `sha-<commit>` tag

If this is the first time the package is published, verify the package visibility in GitHub Packages and set it to public if needed.

This app is best treated as an internal admin tool, not a public-facing website.

Recommended deployment patterns:

- private home lab or LAN
- VPN-only access
- reverse proxy with authentication
- internal server management network

## Security Notes 🔐

This project handles server admin access, so a few things are important.

### Good News

- the admin password is proxied through Next.js API routes
- the password is not sent in URL query strings
- the app does not require a separate database

### Important Tradeoff

If `Remember me` is enabled, the server IP, ports, and admin password are stored in browser local storage on that machine.

That means:

- it is convenient for trusted personal devices
- it is a bad idea on shared or public machines

### Recommended Practice

If you plan to deploy this for regular use:

- put it behind authentication
- keep it on a trusted network
- use HTTPS if exposed beyond your LAN
- avoid sharing browser profiles that have saved credentials

### Use at Your Own Risk

This project is provided as-is, without warranty or liability.

By using it, you accept responsibility for common self-hosting risks such as:

- misconfiguration
- downtime
- broken updates
- security exposure
- credential leakage on your own devices
- data loss or world-state issues
- moderation mistakes or unintended server actions

## Project Structure 🗂️

This is a quick guide to the main folders:

```text
app/          Next.js app routes, layout, providers, API routes
components/   UI components and dashboard panels
lib/          shared helpers, state, types, and Palworld request utilities
public/       static assets such as icons and map images
```

Some especially useful files:

- `app/api/palworld/[...path]/route.ts` - proxy route to the Palworld REST API
- `lib/server-context.tsx` - app-wide server/session state
- `lib/palworld.ts` - Palworld API helpers and payload normalization
- `components/dashboard.tsx` - main dashboard shell
- `components/live-map.tsx` - live map view
- `Dockerfile` - production container build
- `docker-compose.yml` - ready-to-run container deployment using the published image
- `.github/workflows/publish-docker-image.yml` - container build and publish automation

## UI Library and Styling 🎨

This project does not use a large all-in-one UI framework like MUI, Ant Design, or Chakra UI.

Instead, the UI is built with a lighter custom stack:

- Tailwind CSS for styling and layout
- Radix UI primitives for accessible low-level UI behavior
- custom reusable components inside `components/` and `components/ui/`
- a visual style and component direction influenced by `thegridcn`
- Sonner for toast notifications

In practice, that means the visual design is mostly custom and shaped by the `thegridcn` aesthetic, while accessibility and interaction behavior for dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, switches, and sheets are powered by Radix UI primitives.

## Troubleshooting 🧯

### The app opens, but it cannot connect to my server

Check:

- server IP or hostname
- REST API port
- admin password
- firewall rules
- whether the REST API is actually enabled on the server

### The gameplay server works, but the dashboard cannot connect

That usually means the game port is reachable but the REST API is not. Double-check the REST API port and its authentication settings.

### The page loads, but development hot reload is not working

Restart the dev server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

If you are using a LAN URL, make sure you are opening the same machine's active network address and not an outdated one.

### TypeScript complains about generated route files

Run:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

The script already resets and regenerates the route types for you.
